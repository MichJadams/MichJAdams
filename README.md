# Hey, I'm Michaela! 

I'm a software Engineer currently living in NYC 🌆 but soon to move to Minneapolis ❄. I enjoy playing games (Specifically Dota 2, Catan and Apex Legends), reading sci-fi and fantasy and riding my bike all around town (also on Zwift! 🚲). 

## Projects 📦
#### Unity Course 🎒
Working through a course to learn Unity! Currently I've created a number guessing game that 'barrows' heavily from GLAdUS (from Portal). 
And now working on a breakout game.
With my breakout game I'm working on creating interesting blocks that fall, or react to physics. 
I'm also adding interesting ball effects, such as getting larger.

Example of boulder smash game play as of 6-8-2021

 - [x] Ball gets bigger every 5 bounces
 - [x] Player death and restart game loop is complete 
 - [x] Player score is kept
 - [x] Certain blocks fall when hit 
 - [ ] The paddle works as a sea-saw, allowing player to have two balls that bounce one at a time
 - [ ] Create custom assets 

#### Ray Tracer 🎨
I am following a test-first guide to writing a ray tracer. 
This picture is really faint, but there is a precious red parabola for those really looking close.
I have decided to do it in C#!

Look at those beautiful tests 🧪

#### Forgot Password 🤔
A little game a friend came up with where the whole thing is to guess passwords based on hints. This was a proof of concept I made and deployed to surprise him. There isn't any content yet, just a basically game loop and win condition.

I made this game when I was first starting out, and I still enjoy it's concept and design.
