# Hey, I'm Michaela! 

I'm a software Engineer currently living in NYC 🌆 but soon to move to Minneapolis ❄. I enjoy playing games (Specifically Dota 2, Catan and Apex Legends), reading sci-fi and fantasy and riding my bike all around town (also on Zwift! 🚲). 

## Projects 📦

#### Ray Tracer 🎨
I am following a test-first guide to writing a ray tracer. 
This picture is really faint, but there is a precious red parabola for those really looking close.
I have decided to do it in C#!

#### Forgot Password 🤔
A little game a friend came up with where the whole thing is to guess passwords based on hints. This was a proof of concept I made and deployed to surprise him. There isn't any content yet, just a basically game loop and win condition.

#### Battle Bits 🛳
I made this game when I was first starting out, and I still enjoy it's concept and design.

#### Unity Course 🎒
Working through a course to lean Unity! Currently I've created a number guessing game that 'barrows' heavily from GLAdUS (from Portal). 
And now working on a breakout game.
With my breakout game I'm working on creating interesting blocks that fall, or reach to physics. 
And also adding interesting ball effects, such as getting larger.
