# Hey, I'm Michaela! 

I'm a software Engineer currently living in Minneapolis ❄. I enjoy playing games (Currently Gloomhaven, Magic Arena and Dark Souls II), reading sci-fi and fantasy and riding my bike all around town (also on weightlifting!). I'm teaching myself game development in my free time. 

## Projects 📦

### Arabic Typing Practice 
No tutorials this time! Just stumbling around trying to make a little game to help me learn to type in Arabic. I'm using Godot and GDScript. As it stands the game starts and allows a player to type in characters. If the chracter matches it turns green, if it does not the character changes and turns red. 

Lastest Progress: 

This is the visulization of the Leitner System that is the underlying algorithm used to select which words will appear in a given study session

This is a general tour of the new feel of the application

Bare bones beginning

#### Future Features 
 - [ x] Load in vocabulary (currently set to just a single set of words)
 - [ x] Record player score
 - [x ] Use a third party API to pull audio of word pronunciation
 - [ ] Give the option to change the word to English after it is typed
 - [ ] Remove duplicate words when user uploads multiple copies
 - [ ] cache the .mp3 file for each word pronunciation as a resource associated with that word so you don't have to fetch it every time (and also decreases chance of being blocked by reverso)
 - [ ] Create map of code
 - [ ] Figure out why the back button from "settings" stalls/hangs
 - [ ] Write a little explanation of how I got the verbal pronunciation of each word to load 
       
### Ray Tracer 🎨
I am following a test-first guide to writing a ray tracer. 
This picture is really faint, but there is a precious red parabola for those really looking close.
I have decided to do it in C#!

Look at these beautiful tests 🧪

### Unity Course 🎒
Working through a course to learn Unity! Currently I've created a number guessing game that 'barrows' heavily from GLAdUS (from Portal). 
And now working on a breakout game.
With my breakout game I'm working on creating interesting blocks that fall, or react to physics. 
I'm also adding interesting ball effects, such as getting larger. 

![Boulder Smash Game Play](BoulderSmashGamePlay.gif)

Example of boulder smash game play as of 6-8-2021

 - [x] Ball gets bigger every 5 bounces
 - [x] Player death and restart game loop is complete 
 - [x] Player score is kept
 - [x] Certain blocks fall when hit 
 - [ ] The paddle works as a sea-saw, allowing player to have two balls that bounce one at a time
 - [ ] Create custom assets 

### Forgot Password 🤔
A little game a friend came up with where the whole thing is to guess passwords based on hints. This was a proof of concept I made and deployed to surprise him. There isn't any content yet, just a basically game loop and win condition.

### Battle Bits 🛳
I made this game when I was first starting out, and I still enjoy it's concept and design.
